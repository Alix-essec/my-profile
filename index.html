				<h2>My interests and hobbies</h2>
					<ul class="li-color li-font">
						<li>
							I have been learning the piano since I was 7 years old. I am passionate about music in general, wether it be classical pieces or today's pop.
						</li>
						<li>
							I enjoy travelling around the world. I show a particular interest towards Asian countries; thus, I would love to get to know their culture more in depth through a trip or during an exchange.
						</li>
						<li>
							I am very interested in drawing (digital and on paper), editing, designing, calligraphy (hence the experimentation of fonts which may not go well together on this website), and webdesigning. PS: Thank you Le Wagon for your lessons! I spend a lot of time browsing the Internet in search for inspiration. I spend way too much time choosing colours, font or downloading what I consider to be aesthetic pictures. Like this one:
